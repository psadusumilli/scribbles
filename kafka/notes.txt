PRINCIPLES:
**********
'topic' is a logical unit for creation/consumption of messages
topic is made up of 'partitions', an append-only,immutable commit logs
'producers' select a partition to dump a message based on their distribution choice.
messages in partitions are retained based on retention policies
1 complete partition per server
all partitions are replicated across servers
1 partition in a server is leader handling all read/writes, others passively replicated for failover

'consumers' read from partitions using 'offset', just a counter on where they are in the log
consumers can read multiple times from same parition by resetting the offset
consumers are grouped together into groups

only one consumer is guranteed to receive a message in a group, no duplicate receipt
'point': if all consumers belong to same group, they are load balanced within group for every message
'broadcast': if all consumers belong to different groups , they are distributed across groups for every message

1 partition/1 consumer always -> strong ordering

Messages sent by a producer to a particular topic partition will be appended in the order they are sent. 
That is, if a message M1 is sent by the same producer as a message M2, and M1 is sent first, then M1 will have a lower offset than M2 and appear earlier in the log.
A consumer instance sees messages in the order they are stored in the log.
For a topic with replication factor N, we will tolerate up to N-1 server failures without losing any messages committed to the log.
there cannot be more consumer instances than partitions.

GIST
****
topic -> 
	'Parallelism' - N partitions [1 partition/server, 1 partition/consumer (strong ordering)]
	'Replication' - Each partition in N is replicated across N servers with one as leader for R/W, other just Read

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ARCHITECTURE
**************
Persistence:
-------------
The key fact about disk performance is that the throughput of hard drives has been diverging from the latency of a disk seek for the last decade. 
As a result the performance of linear writes on a JBOD configuration with six 7200rpm SATA RAID-5 array is about 600MB/sec but the performance of random writes is only about 100k/sec—a difference of over 6000X. 
These linear reads and writes are the most predictable of all usage patterns, and are heavily optimized by the operating system. 
A modern operating system provides read-ahead and write-behind techniques that prefetch data in large block multiples and group smaller logical writes into large physical writes. 

All disk reads and writes will go through the disk cache in RAM.
In-process memory cache like JVM heap suffer from big/many objects and GC, so pagecache looks better.
Disk cache will stay warm even if the service is restarted, whereas the in-process cache will need to be rebuilt in memory 

Constant time O(1)
------------------
Traditional messagsing systems use B-tree O(LogN) which coupled with disk speed (say 10ms a pop) is pretty slow.
A simple write-at-head, read-at-tail without blocking each other gives O(N)
help utlilize cheap slow-seek drives

Efficiency
----------
Once poor disk access patterns have been eliminated, there are two common causes of inefficiency in this type of system: 
	too many small I/O operations, and excessive byte copying.

'solution: batch copy - too many io ops'
To avoid this, our protocol is built around a "message set" abstraction that naturally groups messages together. 
This allows network requests to group messages together and amortize the overhead of the network roundtrip rather than sending a single message at a time. 
The server in turn appends chunks of messages to its log in one go, and the consumer fetches large linear chunks at a time.	

'solution: custom binary format - '
client and server share common binary format
The message log maintained by the broker is itself just a directory of files, each populated by a sequence of message sets that have been written to disk in the same format used by the producer and consumer.
Maintaining this common format allows optimization of the most important operation: network transfer of persistent log chunks. 
Modern unix operating systems offer a highly optimized code path for transferring data out of pagecache to a socket; in Linux this is done with the 'sendfile' system call.

To understand the impact of 'sendfile', it is important to understand the common data path for transfer of data from file to socket:
	The operating system reads data from the disk into pagecache in kernel space
	The application reads the data from kernel space into a user-space buffer
	The application writes the data back into kernel space into a socket buffer
	The operating system copies the data from the socket buffer to the NIC buffer where it is sent over the network

This is clearly inefficient, there are four copies and two system calls. 
Using sendfile, this re-copying is avoided by allowing the OS to send the data from pagecache to the network directly. 
So in this optimized path, only the final copy to the NIC buffer is needed.

We expect a common use case to be multiple consumers on a topic.
Using the zero-copy optimization above, data is copied into pagecache exactly once and reused on each consumption instead of being stored in memory and copied out to kernel space every time it is read. 
This combination of 'pagecache and sendfile' means that on a Kafka cluster where the consumers are mostly caught up you will see no read activity on the disks whatsoever as they will be serving data entirely from cache.


Compression:
-----------
To save network io cost, efficient compression requires compressing multiple messages together rather than compressing each message individually.
Kafka supports this by allowing recursive message sets. A batch of messages can be clumped together compressed and sent to the server in this form. 
This batch of messages will be written in compressed form and will remain compressed in the log and will only be decompressed by the consumer.
gzip and snappy

producer
--------
Producers always talk to Brokers who abtract everything like which partition is the leader, which server is alive.
But producer cna do the partition mechanism and dump in any partition they want.
'Batching' is one of the big drivers of efficiency, and to enable batching the Kafka producer will attempt to accumulate data in memory and to send out larger batches in a single request. 
The batching can be configured to accumulate no more than a fixed number of messages and to wait no longer than some fixed latency bound (say 64k or 10 ms).

consumer:
---------
'Pull based' consuming giving control to consumers for batch pulls
advantage of a pull-based system is that it lends itself to aggressive batching of data sent to the consumer.
The deficiency of a naive pull-based system is that if the broker has no data the consumer may end up polling in a tight loop, effectively busy-waiting for data to arrive. 
To avoid this we have parameters in our pull request that allow the consumer request to block in a "long poll" waiting until data arrives 
(and optionally waiting until a given number of bytes is available to ensure large transfer sizes).

'No message acknowledgement' mechanism which leads to inefficiency and lost messages tracking. 
Just track the int offset number provided by consumer

A consumer can deliberately rewind back to an old 'offset' and re-consume data. 
This violates the common contract of a queue, but turns out to be an essential feature for many consumers
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Message Semantics
****************
In general, in any messaging system, the following Semantics are possible.
'At most once'—Messages may be lost but are never redelivered.
'At least once'—Messages are never lost but may be redelivered.
'Exactly once'—this is what people actually want, each message is delivered once and only once.

Kafka guarantees 'at-least-once' delivery by default.
But allows the user to implement 'at most once' delivery by disabling retries on the producer and committing its offset prior to processing a batch of messages. 
'Exactly-once delivery' requires co-operation with the destination storage system but Kafka provides the offset which makes implementing this straight-forward

Replication
***********
'X' Topic can have 'Y' Partitions across 'Z' Brokers
For X, Y > Z
'Only one Leader handling R/W in Y partitions'
Leader chooses the ordering of values provided to it.
Followers are just like any consumer feeding from leader

For Kafka node liveness or being in 'sync' has two conditions
	A node must be able to maintain its session with ZooKeeper (via ZooKeeper heartbeat mechanism)
	If it is a slave it must replicate the writes happening on the leader and not fall "too far" behind
 
Quorum
------
A message is considered "committed" when all in sync  'ISR' replicas for that partition have applied it to their log.	
 
In general, for a quorum :
 Let say we have 2f+1 replicas. 
 If f+1 replicas must receive a message prior to a commit being declared by the leader, 
 and if we elect a new leader by electing the follower with the most complete log from at least f+1 replicas, then, with no more than f failures, 
 the leader is guaranteed to have all committed messages. 
 This is because among any f+1 replicas, there must be at least one replica that contains all committed messages.

 To tolerate 1 failure requires 3 copies of the data, 
 and to tolerate 2 failures requires 5 copies of the data. 
 In our experience having only enough redundancy to tolerate a single failure is not enough for a practical system, 
 but doing every write five times, with 5x the disk space requirements and 1/5th the throughput, is not very practical for large volume data problems. 

 'ISR'
 Kafka takes a slightly different approach to choosing its quorum set. 
 Instead of majority vote, Kafka dynamically maintains a set of in-sync replicas (ISR) that are caught-up to the leader. 
 Only members of this set are eligible for election as leader. 
 A write to a Kafka partition is not considered committed until all in-sync replicas have received the write. 
 This ISR set is persisted to ZooKeeper whenever it changes. 
 Because of this, any replica in the ISR is eligible to be elected leader.
 This is an important factor for Kafka usage model where there are many partitions and ensuring leadership balance is important. 
 With this ISR model and 'f+1' replicas, a Kafka topic can tolerate 'f' failures without losing committed messages.
 
 'isr failures'
 A failed ISR must fully re-sync again even if it lost unflushed data in its crash.
 In case of all ISR failures
	 1 Wait for a replica in the ISR to come back to life and choose this replica as the leader (hopefully it still has all its data).
	 2 Choose the first replica (not necessarily in the ISR) that comes back to life as the leader.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Log Compaction
 ***************
ensures that Kafka will always retain at least the 'last known value for each message key' within the log of data for a single topic partition.
Log compaction is a mechanism to give finer-grained per-record retention, rather than the coarser-grained time-based retention. 
The idea is to selectively remove records where we have a more recent update with the same primary key. 
This way the log is guaranteed to have at least the last state for each key.
This retention policy can be set per-topic, so a single cluster can have some topics where retention is enforced by size or time and other topics where retention is enforced by compaction.

compaction happens at older offsets at tail end of log.
if say 10, 21, 32 got compacted, 32 will be returned for any call to 10|21|32

Compaction also allows for deletes. A message with a key and a null payload will be treated as a delete from the log. 
The compaction is done in the background by periodically recopying log segments. 

Cleaning does not block reads and can be throttled to use no more than a configurable amount of I/O throughput to avoid impacting producers and consumers

The log cleaner is disabled by default. To enable it set the server config
  log.cleaner.enable=true
This will start the pool of cleaner threads. To enable log cleaning on a particular topic you can add the log-specific property
  log.cleanup.policy=compact
This can be done either at topic creation time or using the alter topic command.

Producer API:
*************

Producer API that wraps the 2 low-level producers
	1 kafka.producer.SyncProducer
	2 kafka.producer.async.AsyncProducer.

	class Producer {
		
	  /* Sends the data, partitioned by key to the topic using either the */
	  /* synchronous or the asynchronous producer */
	  public void send(kafka.javaapi.producer.ProducerData<K,V> producerData);

	  /* Sends a list of data, partitioned by key to the topic using either */
	  /* the synchronous or the asynchronous producer */
	  public void send(java.util.List<kafka.javaapi.producer.ProducerData<K,V>> producerData);

	  /* Closes the producer and cleans up */	
	  public void close();

	}	

Goals:
-------
1 'batching'
handle queueing/buffering of multiple producer requests and asynchronous dispatch of the batched data -
kafka.producer.Producer provides the ability to batch multiple produce requests (producer.type=async), before serializing and dispatching them to the appropriate kafka broker partition. 
The size of the batch can be controlled by a few config parameters. 

As events enter a queue, they are 'buffered in a queue', until either 'queue.time or batch.size' is reached.
'A background thread (kafka.producer.async.ProducerSendThread) dequeues' the batch of data and lets the kafka.producer.
'EventHandler' serialize and send the data to the appropriate kafka broker partition. 
A custom event handler can be plugged in through the event.handler config parameter. 
At various stages of this producer queue pipeline, it is helpful to be able to 'inject callbacks', either for plugging in custom logging/tracing code or custom monitoring logic. 
This is possible by implementing the 'kafka.producer.async.CallbackHandler' interface and setting callback.handler config parameter to that class.

2 'encoding'
handles the serialization of data through a user-specified Encoder -
interface Encoder<T> {
  public Message toMessage(T data);
}
The default is the no-op kafka.serializer.DefaultEncoder

2 'partitioning'
provides software load balancing through an optionally user-specified Partitioner -
The routing decision is influenced by the kafka.producer.Partitioner.

interface Partitioner<T> {
   int partition(T key, int numPartitions);
}
The partition API uses the key and the number of available broker partitions to return a 'partition id'. 
This id is used as an index into a sorted list of broker_ids and partitions to pick a broker partition for the producer request.
The default partitioning strategy is 'hash(key)%numPartitions'. 
If the key is null, then a random broker partition is picked. A custom partitioning strategy can also be plugged in using the partitioner.class config parameter.

Consumer API
*************
2 levels of consumer APIs. 
	1 
	The low-level "simple" API maintains a connection to a single broker and has a close correspondence to the network requests sent to the server. 
	This API is completely stateless, with the offset being passed in on every request, allowing the user to maintain this metadata however they choose.
	2
	The high-level API hides the details of brokers from the consumer and allows consuming off the cluster of machines without concern for the underlying topology. 
	It also maintains the state of what has been consumed. 
	The high-level API also provides the ability to subscribe to topics that match a filter expression 

	ConsumerConnector connector = Consumer.create(consumerConfig);
	interface ConsumerConnector {
	  /**
	   * This method is used to get a list of KafkaStreams, which are iterators over
	   * MessageAndMetadata objects from which you can obtain messages and their
	   * associated metadata (currently only topic).
	   *  Input: a map of <topic, #streams>
	   *  Output: a map of <topic, list of message streams>
	   */
	  public Map<String,List<KafkaStream>> createMessageStreams(Map<String,Int> topicCountMap);

	  /**
	   * You can also obtain a list of KafkaStreams, that iterate over messages
	   * from topics that match a TopicFilter. (A TopicFilter encapsulates a
	   * whitelist or a blacklist which is a standard Java regex.)
	   */
	  public List<KafkaStream> createMessageStreamsByFilter(
	      TopicFilter topicFilter, int numStreams);

	  /* Commit the offsets of all messages consumed so far. */
	  public commitOffsets()
	  
	  /* Shut down the connector */
	  public shutdown()
	}

This API is centered around iterators, implemented by the KafkaStream class. 
Each 'KafkaStream' represents the stream of messages from one or more partitions on one or more servers. 
Each stream is used for single threaded processing, so the client can provide the number of desired streams in the create call. 
Thus a stream may represent the merging of multiple server partitions (to correspond to the number of processing threads), but each partition only goes to one stream.
So
	topicCountMap of t1-2, t2->3 gives a stream map of t1->2 streams, t2->3 streams
	1 stream processed by 1 thread

The createMessageStreams call registers the consumer for the topic, which results in rebalancing the consumer/broker assignment. 
The 'API encourages creating many topic streams in a single call in order to minimize this rebalancing'. 
The createMessageStreamsByFilter call (additionally) registers watchers to discover new topics that match its filter. 
Note that each stream that createMessageStreamsByFilter returns may iterate over messages from multiple topics (i.e., if multiple topics are allowed by the filter).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Network Layer
**************
The network layer is a fairly straight-forward NIO server. 
The sendfile implementation is done by giving the 'MessageSet' interface a writeTo method. 
This allows the file-backed message set to use the more efficient 'transferTo' implementation instead of an in-process buffered write. 
The threading model is a single acceptor thread and N processor threads which handle a fixed number of connections each.
