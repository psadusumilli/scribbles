What every programmer should know abt Memory?

CHAPTER1: COMMODITY HARDWARE:
------------------------------*
Most chipsets follow this design: 

1: Chipset|
-----------
'Northbridge'=> CPUs and RAM connect to this bus. All CPUs connect to Northbridge via 'FSB (Front Side Bus)'
			  	CPUs talk between each other using this.
			  	RAM sometimes connect via memory controllers, this depends on RAM technology.
			  	'NUMA'(non uniform memory access): there is no Northbridge, just captive RAMs to each processor. 
			  	But there is a cost in accessing RAM belonging to a peer CPU.

'Southbridge'=> All devices like PCI, SATA, USB connect to this.
			  	CPU will talk with these devices all the way through North and South bridges
			  	'DMA' (direct memory access): These devices need not go through the CPU to access RAM and can directly access via Northbridge, 
			  	so now contention for RAM between them and CPU

2: RAMs|
---------
'Static SRAM'=> cells based on transistors, 
			  	fast in saying 0 or 1, 
			  	rectangular signal, 
			  	no refresh cycles needed.
			  	high manufacture cost, specialised use only
			  	used in cpu caches

'Dynamic DRAM'=>cells based on capacitor, 
 			  	slow being dependent on capacitor discharge, 
 			  	not a rectangular signal so need processors to decipher 0/1, 
 			  	need refresh cycles
 			  	low cost, low space, prevalent use.
 			  	cells are accessed using RAS(Row address selection) and CAS(Column address selection) multiplexers and de-multiplexers
 			  	many types exists, Asynchronous DRAM, Rambus DRAM (obsolete, not widely used), Synchronous DRAM (SDRAM), Double Data Rate DRAM(DDR)
