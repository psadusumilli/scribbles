What every programmer should know abt Memory?

CHAPTER1: COMMODITY HARDWARE:
------------------------------*
Most chipsets follow this design: 

1: Chipset|
-----------
'Northbridge'=> CPUs and RAM connect to this bus. All CPUs connect to Northbridge via 'FSB (Front Side Bus)'
			  	CPUs talk between each other using this.
			  	RAM sometimes connect via memory controllers, this depends on RAM technology.
			  	'NUMA'(non uniform memory access): there is no Northbridge, just captive RAMs to each processor. 
			  	But there is a cost in accessing RAM belonging to a peer CPU.

'Southbridge'=> All devices like PCI, SATA, USB connect to this.
			  	CPU will talk with these devices all the way through North and South bridges
			  	'DMA' (direct memory access): These devices need not go through the CPU to access RAM and can directly access via Northbridge, 
			  	so now contention for RAM between them and CPU

2: RAMs|
--------*
'Static SRAM'=> 
cells based on transistors, 
fast in saying 0 or 1, 
rectangular signal, 
no refresh cycles needed.
high manufacture cost, specialised use only
used in cpu caches

'Dynamic DRAM'=>
cells based on capacitor, 
slow being dependent on capacitor discharge, 
not a rectangular signal so need processors to decipher 0/1, 
need refresh cycles
low cost, low space, prevalent use.
cells are accessed using RAS(Row address selection) and CAS(Column address selection) multiplexers and de-multiplexers
many types exists, Asynchronous DRAM, Rambus DRAM (obsolete, not widely used), Synchronous DRAM (SDRAM), Double Data Rate DRAM(DDR)

3:'Types of DRAM':
----------------*
'SDRAM'=>
Synchronous dynamic random access memory (SDRAM) is DRAM that is synchronized with the system bus. 
Classic DRAM has an asynchronous interface, which means that it responds as quickly as possible to changes in control inputs. 
SDRAM has a synchronous interface, meaning that it waits for a clock signal before responding to control inputs and is therefore synchronized with the computer system bus. 
The clock is used to drive an internal finite state machine that pipelines incoming commands. 
The data storage area is divided into several banks, allowing the chip to work on several memory access commands at a time, interleaved among the separate banks. 
This allows higher data access rates than an asynchronous DRAM.
SDRAM spits out one word per cycle

	'DDR1' => Double Data Rate SDRAM , 2 words read/write per cycle
	'DDR2' => Double Data Rate SDRAM , 4 words read/write per cycle
	'DDR3' => Double Data Rate SDRAM , 8 words read/write per cycle
	'DDR4' => Double Data Rate SDRAM , 8 words read/write per cycle, some interleaved data banks.

'DRAM Access'=>
First RAS signal, then CAS signal is sent on the address line
2-3-2-8-T1. This means:
	w 2 CAS Latency (CL) - delay between CAS and Data availability is CAS Latency |2-2.5 clock cycles.
	x 3 RAS-to-CAS delay (tRCD) - First RAS signal, then CAS signal is sent on the address line
	y 2 RAS Precharge (tRP) - cycles between precharge command and the row selection
	z 8 Active to Precharge delay (tRAS) - time taken to switch one row to other (RAS switch)
	T T1 Command Rate
BIOS settings can help tweak these latency timings. high performance servers do it, literature available.
