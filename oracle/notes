"Data blocks":At the finest level of granularity, Oracle Database data is stored in data blocks. One data block corresponds to a specific number of bytes on disk.
"Extents":An extent is a specific number of logically contiguous data blocks, obtained in a single allocation, used to store a specific type of information.
"Segments": A segment is a set of extents allocated for a user object (for example, a table or index), undo data, or temporary data.
"Tablespaces": A database is divided into logical storage units called tablespaces. A tablespace is the logical container for a segment. Each tablespace contains at least one data file.

	2 "pooling"
		http://www.tomcatexpert.com/blog/2010/04/01/configuring-jdbc-pool-high-concurrency

		"spring-boot" used tomcat datasource

		spring.datasource.max-active=100 //is the maximum number of established connections to the database. 
		spring.datasource.max-idle=8 //behaves differently depending on if the pool sweeper, a background thread that can test idle connections and resize the pool while the pool is active
		spring.datasource.min-idle=8 //minimum number of connections always established after the connection pool has reached this size. The pool can shrink to a smaller number of connections if the maxAge attribute
		spring.datasource.initial-size=10
		spring.datasource.validation-query=SELECT 1//the query SELECT 1 is executed each time the Java code calls Connection con = dataSource.getConnection();.
		spring.datasource.test-on-borrow=false
		spring.datasource.test-on-return=false
		spring.datasource.test-while-idle=
		spring.datasource.time-between-eviction-runs-millis= //The sweeper runs every timeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis milliseconds.
		spring.datasource.min-evictable-idle-time-millis=
		spring.datasource.max-wait=
		spring.datasource.jmx-enabled=false


		The sweeper runs every timeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis milliseconds.
		The maxIdle attribute is defined as follows:

		Pool sweeper disabled - If the idle pool is larger than maxIdle, the connection will be closed when returned to the pool
		Pool sweeper enabled - Number of idle connections can grow beyond maxIdle but can shrink down to minIdle if the connection has been idle for longer than minEvictableIdleTimeMillis. This may sounds strange that the pool can will not close connections even if the idle pool is larger than maxIdle. It is actually optimal behavior. Imagine the following scenario:


		100 parallel requests served by 100 threads
		Each thread borrows a connection 3 times during a request
		In this scenario, if we had maxIdle="50" then we could end up closing and opening 50x3 connections. 
		This taxes the database and slows down the application. During peak traffic spikes like this, we want to be able to utilize all the pooled connections. 
		So we definitely want to have the pool sweeper enabled. There is an additional attribute we mentioned here, "maxAge". 
		maxAge defines the time in milliseconds that a connection can be open/established. 
		When a connection is returned to the pool, if the connection has been connected and the time it was first connected is longer than the maxAge value, it will be closed.


		As we saw by the "isPoolSweeper" enabled algorithm, the sweeper is enabled when one of the following conditions is met
			timeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis>0 AND removeAbandoned=true AND removeAbandonedTimeout>0
			timeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis>0 AND suspectTimeout>0
			timeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis>0 AND testWhileIdle=true AND validationQuery!=null
			timeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis>0 AND minEvictableIdleTimeMillis>0 (timer && getMinEvictableIdleTimeMillis()>0);

		Leaks:
		removeAbandoned - set to true if we want to detect leaked connections
		removeAbandonedTimeout - the number of seconds from when dataSource.getConnection was called to when we consider it abandoned
		logAbandoned - set to true if we should log that a connection was abandoned. If this option is set to true, a stack trace is recorded during the dataSource.getConnection call and is printed when a connection is not returned.	


	3 "backup and recovery"
		need to talk with dbas on recovery manager


	4 "replication"
		Oracle Streams, a built-in feature of the Oracle database, is a data replication and integration feature. 
		It provides a flexible infrastructure that meets a wide variety of information sharing needs. 
		Oracle Streams enables the propagation of data, transactions and events in a data stream either within a database, or from one database to another


	5 "migration"
		Database migrations are carried out using flywaydb.org which allow us to 
			Recreate a database from scratch
			Make it clear at all times what state a database is in
			Migrate in a deterministic way from your current version of the database to a newer one
		FlwayDB applies qql or java migrations in its classpath
		FlwayDB tracks the migrations applied via a single tracker table SCHEMA_VERSION in database.
